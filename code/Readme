Programming file description:

prb1:

Training and testing LeNet-5 architecture on MNIST dataset.
Plotting accuracy vs epochs graphs on training and testing sets.
Testing the trained model from cnn_p1 on negative images

prb2prta:

Training a new network for better performance on original and
negative images.
Plotting accuracy vs epochs graphs on training and testing sets.

prb2prtb:

Training and testing LeNet-5 architecture on colored mnist dataset.
Plotting accuracy vs epochs graphs on training and testing sets.

prb2prtc:

Testing Translation Invariance of model trained from cnn_p1.
Plotting accuracy vs translational invariances on testing data.
cnn_p5: Upda

Guidelines for running the code:

This code uses torch. Make sure you have installed the latest version
of torch on your machine.
The input data (mnist test and train) must be contained in the source
folder.
To compile and start training just type:
> dofile "prb1.lua"
> dofile "prb2prta.lua"
> dofile "prb2prtb.lua"
> dofile "prb2prtc.lua"
